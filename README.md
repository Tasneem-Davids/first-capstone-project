# Online Store

## This is a simple online store I created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### How does it work?

Once you download this code, you can open the home page html file in any browser you'd like by double clicking on the file. It's pretty straight forward from here 
if you've used an online store before. You simply navigate to the products and add them to your cart. You can also check your cart and you'll see all the items there 
as well as the total amount and some check out options. This task was to help me get a better understanding of how to use HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
